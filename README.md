# zero_forcing
This repository contains code for finding minimum zero forcing sets and minimum connected zero forcing sets of graphs.  

The .edg files for various test instances are in the folder test_graphs.

The best way to run these methods is to download the whole repository and follow the compilation and usage instruction in the source file for each program.  However, the methods can also be downloaded and run individually with the caveat that the integer programming methods rely on the forcing_lib.hpp header file.
